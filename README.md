# NPU Project

## Prerequisite

Our NPU Project uses [gemmini](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini) in [chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard), so you have to set up chipyard environment before test our project.

`make chipyard` command sets up chipyard environment easily.

if the environment ready, set `CHIPYARD` environment variable to point the chipyard directory.

## run test operation file

Execute `make` to fetch gemmini, alter files, build and run.
