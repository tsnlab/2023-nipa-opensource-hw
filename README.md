# NPU Project

## Prerequisite

Our NPU Project uses [gemmini](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini) in [chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard), so you have to set up chipyard environment before test our project.

Follow the instructions [here](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Chipyard-Basics/Initial-Repo-Setup.html).

if the environment ready, set `CHIPYARD` environment variable to point the chipyard directory.

## run test operation file

Execute `make` to fetch gemmini, alter files, build and run.
